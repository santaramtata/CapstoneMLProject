    "### NON-TECHNICAL EXPLANATION OF THE PROJECT\n",
    "Concrete is the most widely used structural material for construction today. Traditionally, concrete has been fabricated from a few well-defined components: Cement, water, fine aggregate, coarse aggregate, etc. In concrete mix design and quality control, the strength of concrete is regarded as the most important property. Many other properties of concrete, such as elastic modulus, water tightness or impermeability, resistance to weathering agents, etc.\n",
    "are directly related to the strength. The compressive strength of concrete is many times greater than other types of strength, and a  majority of concrete elements are designed to take advantage of the higher compressive strength of the material. Most often, an ultimate target in the mixture design is the 28th day compressive strength. The 28th day compressive strength is usually determined based on a standard uniaxial compression test and is accepted universally as a general index of concrete strength.\n",
    "Generally, concrete testing procedures are time consuming and experimental errors are inevitable. An attempt is made to be able to estimate the compressive strength of concrete using AI methods.\n"

    "Tried out various regression approahces avaliable under SciKit tool and chose MLP Regressor. MLP regressor is a powerful tool that uses multilayer perceptron to come up with a best fitted nonlinear line in explaining the relationship between dependent variable and independent variables by learning from the data."
